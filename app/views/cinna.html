      <h1 class="case-study-title">The Setup</h1>
      <p class="case-study-paragraph">Cinna Liselott, a dear friend of mine, is a New York City based puppeteer.  She is fortunate to have a full time position creating and performing puppet shows throughout the city, but wanted to have a site of her own as she wanted to expand her horizons through children’s puppet parties.</p>
      <p class="case-study-paragraph">I was interested in working with Cinna as I wanted to gain some more experience with parallax scrolling, and I felt that she had a unique product that deserved a unique site.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="col-md-4">
      <h1 class="case-study-title">The Plan Of Attack</h1>
      <p class="case-study-paragraph">For this project, Cinna only needed a way for parents to see what services she offered and a way to contact her, that’s about it.  Since I was more interested in creating a parallax effect, I decided to keep it simple and focus more on the functions and to keep it all client side.</p>
      <p class="case-study-paragraph">I decided to use Bootstrap for a CSS framework out of preference, and use SASS partials using a widget-based CSS over object oriented CSS.  All of the movement I decided to handle with hand written jQuery (rather than using something pre-written) so that I could figure out how parallax scrolling really worked.</p>

    </div>

    <div class="col-md-4">
      <h1 class="case-study-title">The Solution</h1>
      <p class="case-study-paragraph">The end result was a simple, single page site with aspects of parallax scrolling.  (The effect looked similar, but the background doesn’t actually scroll slower than the foreground.)  For the more information boxes, I used some jQuery to show and hide elements.</p>

      <p class="case-study-paragraph">Also, as there was no actual budget for this project and it was a single page application, I was able to deploy it as a github page with its own domain name. </p>
