      <h1 class="case-study-title">The Setup</h1>
      <p class="case-study-paragraph">Amy Van Doran, founder of Modern Love Club, is a New York City based matchmaker who cares deeply about her clients’ love lives.  When I met Amy, she had a simple handmade site, which did not convey the level of personalized attention that she gives to her clientele, nor did it list all of the services available.</p>
      <p class="case-study-paragraph">Amy was my first client, and I’ve had an ongoing (code based) relationship with her and her site for the last two years.  I approached Amy to build her site as it was an excellent chance for me to learn more about front end development as well as anticipating and meeting needs of small business owners.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="col-md-4">
      <h1 class="case-study-title">The Plan Of Attack</h1>
      <p class="case-study-paragraph"> After consulting with Amy and her branding team initially, I realized that I didn’t need to store any information, so the best route would be a simple responsive site with the pre-existing, subscription-based MMPro code dropped in neatly for form submissions to an external database.</p>
      <p class="case-study-paragraph">
      When rebuilding Modern Love Club it was kept entirely client-side as services such as You Can Book Me and MMPro are effective for scheduling and matchmaking.  Notable changes to the site is concise and compartmentalized code thanks to Sass and Compass partials, Bootstrap over Foundation and jQuery functions for extra sparkle on the FAQ page.</p>

    </div>

    <div class="col-md-4">
      <h1 class="case-study-title">The Solution</h1>
      <p class="case-study-paragraph">The first time I made a website for Amy (<a class="old-site" href="http://ninjaofawesome.github.io/old_amy_van_doran/">seen here</a>), I used Foundation 3 to handle responsive aspects of the site and plugged in the MMPro widget for form submissions.  Although a novice project, it was easy to maintain for the next year and a half, and conveyed to Amy's clientele her full range of services and contact methods.</p>

      <p class="case-study-paragraph">The rebuilt site, thanks to better written code and proper use of tools, is much easier to use on multiple devices as well as much easier to maintain from a developer's standpoint.  This project was a good example of improvement over my front end development career, I look forward to more delightful long term clients like Amy.
