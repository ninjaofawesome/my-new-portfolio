      <h1 class="case-study-title">The Setup</h1>
      <p class="case-study-paragraph">Techway was a group extern project that I had the pleasure of working on while I was attending Flatiron.  It was meant to give us valuable experience working with clients and rails, while giving a service to a startup who might not otherwise be able to afford a custom built project.</p>
      <p class="case-study-paragraph">For this project, we met with a local PC repair company run by Jamel Graham.  When we met Mr. Graham, he had a site that wasnâ€™t really fitting the needs of his small company- it was hard for him to get clientele to contact him, difficult to maintain his records and update services as he needed.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="col-md-4">
      <h1 class="case-study-title">The Plan Of Attack</h1>
      <p class="case-study-paragraph">
After consulting with Mr. Graham, we determined that he would benefit most from a custom built content management system that had administrative and client side features without many bells and whistles.  On the client side, he needed a form for submissions, a form reviews, a list of services and (as it was important to Mr. Graham) positive reviews.  On the admin side, Mr. Graham needed a way to organize client records, choose reviews to feature on the landing page and have the ability to update services.</p>
      <p class="case-study-paragraph">We used Rails 3.2 for this project and minimally used gems for components for a richer learning experience.</p>

    </div>

    <div class="col-md-4">
      <h1 class="case-study-title">The Solution</h1>
      <p class="case-study-paragraph">Working with a group of three, we built him a content management system which met all of his needs.  We deployed his project to Heroku for staging and set up a server on Digital Ocean for production.  Our project was completed on time, with all parameters met.
</p>

      <p class="case-study-paragraph">One of the best parts of working on Techway is that with a group of three other students, we were able to quad program, each taking turns to drive the programming and to find solutions for areas we got stuck in collaboratively.  </p>
