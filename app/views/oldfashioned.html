      <h1 class="case-study-title">The Setup</h1>
      <p class="case-study-paragraph">Old Fashioned was a project that I put together as I wanted to learn how to use Bourbon, Neat and Bitters and I thought it would be nice to have a project built with Compass, which I also very much enjoy using.  </p>
      <p class="case-study-paragraph">Since it was a fun project for my own learning, I thought it might be nice to create a boilerplate so that others might be able to get up and running for rapid prototyping or other front end work without Bootstrap or Foundation.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="col-md-4">
      <h1 class="case-study-title">The Plan Of Attack</h1>
      <p class="case-study-paragraph">I decided to set this project up for anyone who had never really used Bourbon, Neat or Bitters before by setting up a front end scaffold where the user could drop in components as they needed them into the partials called styles under bourbon and mymixins under the Bourbon directory.  This is only a rough guide- additional partials can be added as necessary.</p>
      <p class="case-study-paragraph">Then I created an index page to ramp the user up even faster with these components.  This page is really just to show how all the working parts fit together roughly. </p>

    </div>

    <div class="col-md-4">
      <h1 class="case-study-title">The Solution</h1>
      <p class="case-study-paragraph">The end result was a concise, partially responsive boilerplate perfect for low-complexity projects.  I put the work onto a public repository and created a github page to demo the project as well as to share. I also included a contact method as Iâ€™d be happy to hear users comments and field questions.  Building Old Fashioned was a great learning experience as well as something valuable to share!</p>
