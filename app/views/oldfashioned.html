      <h1 class="case-study-title">The Setup</h1>
      <p class="case-study-paragraph">Old Fashioned was a project that I put together as I wanted to learn how to use Bourbon, Neat and Bitters worked.  And, since I really like Compass, I thought it would be a nice idea to have all these files ready to go in a compact repository ready at a moment’s notice.</p>
      <p class="case-study-paragraph">Having a project to do for my own learning pleasure was nice, but I thought I’d kick it up a notch by making a breakable toy for others.  So instead of just making a neat little site to throw away, I decided to make this into a boilerplate for other developers to use as well, which meant focusing on the documentation more and making sure that I wasn’t being sloppy.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="col-md-4">
      <h1 class="case-study-title">The Plan Of Attack</h1>
      <p class="case-study-paragraph"> decided to set this project up for anyone who had never really used Bourbon, Neat or Bitters before by setting up a front end scaffold where the user could drop in components as they needed them.  I clearly labeled these partials in the Bourbon directory (mymixins.scss) and Neat directory (styles.scss), putting in just enough to give anyone a quick idea on how to use these libraries.</p>
      <p class="case-study-paragraph">Then I created an index page to ramp the user up even faster with these components.  This page is really just to show how all the working parts fit together roughly. </p>

    </div>

    <div class="col-md-4">
      <h1 class="case-study-title">The Solution</h1>
      <p class="case-study-paragraph">The end result was a concise, partially responsive boilerplate perfect for low-complexity projects.  I put the work onto a public repository and created a github page to demo the project as well as to share. I also included a contact method as I’d be happy to hear users comments and field questions.</p>
